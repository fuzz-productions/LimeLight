##How to use
_________________________________________________________

####Add to your application:
    
Include it in your project as a library and then modify the following methods in your main activity:
``` java
        @Override
        protected void onResume() {
            super.onResume();
            LimeLight.onResume(this);
        }

        @Override
        protected void onPause() {
            super.onPause();
            LimeLight.onPause();
        }

        @Override
        public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {
            super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);
            LimeLight.onWindowFocusChanged(this, hasFocus);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
            LimeLight.onCreateOptionsMenu(this, menu);
            return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
        }  
```
Run the application, and LimeLight's UI menu should appear on top.
